my experience at Orlando Health was very not good it didn't really suit what I was looking for I was trying to find a doctor that could assist me with my heart problems and all I got were many nurses trying to tell me many different things I was not able to get to the root of the problem finally after quite a few hours I was able to talk talk to somebody who knew what was going on but then I had to schedule more appointments to come back I do not recommend this service
